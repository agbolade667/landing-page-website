# Landing Page Website


This codebase makes a static website interactive by reacting to user's action. 

It implements conversion of a static HTML page into an interactive webpage using JavaScript and HTML DOM. The DOM is manipulated to write new navigation menu items to the static web page, and move from one section of the website to another.
The Scroll bar is also interactive. 

App

The app.js file is programmed to listen to events based on the user's activity and change the background of a section when the section is viewed.
